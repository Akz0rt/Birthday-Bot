# Discord Birthday Bot

A Discord bot that manages and celebrates server members' birthdays, with an AI assistant powered by OpenAI.

## Features

- Set birthdays via a slash command modal (DD/MM format)
- Look up any member's birthday and days remaining
- List all birthdays coming in the next 7 days
- Automatic birthday announcements in a designated channel
- Role assignment on a member's birthday
- Daily birthday checks at a configurable time and timezone
- AI assistant that responds to @mentions or in a dedicated channel, with natural language support for querying and setting birthdays

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/birthday-set` | Opens a modal to set your own birthday (DD/MM format) |
| `/birthday @user` | Shows a user's birthday and how many days until it |
| `/birthdays-coming` | Lists all birthdays occurring in the next 7 days |

## AI Assistant

The bot includes a conversational AI assistant backed by OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini).

### How to trigger it

- **@mention** the bot in any channel: `@BirthdayBot when is @Alice's birthday?`
- **Send any message** in the channel configured as `AI_CHANNEL_ID`

### What it can do

- Look up a member's birthday
- List upcoming birthdays
- Set your own birthday via natural language ("set my birthday to March 15")
- Hold general conversation

### Permissions

Users may only set their **own** birthday through the AI. Requests to set another user's birthday are refused.

### Example interactions

```
User: @BirthdayBot when is @Sarah's birthday?
Bot:  Sarah's birthday is on 24 June. That's 47 days away!

User: @BirthdayBot set my birthday to 10/08
Bot:  Done! I've set your birthday to 10 August.

User: @BirthdayBot who has a birthday this week?
Bot:  Coming up in the next 7 days: Alex (tomorrow), Jordan (in 5 days).
```

The assistant maintains per-channel conversation history (up to 20 messages) and uses OpenAI function calling to read and write Cosmos DB directly.

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Birthday-Bot
npm install
```

### 2. Create a .env file

Copy the template below into a file named `.env` at the project root and fill in all values.

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=

CHECK_TIME=00:00
TIMEZONE=UTC
COSMOS_ENDPOINT=
COSMOS_KEY=
COSMOS_DB_NAME=BirthdayBotDB
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### 3. Enable Message Content Intent

In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

1. Select your application
2. Go to **Bot**
3. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Message Content Intent**
